Question1)


Make files in scoobies named buffy.txt, giles.txt and angel.txt 



Copy angel.txt into the vamps directory 


Delete the vamps directory and everything inside it 

Inside of my directory /hansol_kim, mkdir "scobbies" and use ls to check if it is in the hansol_kim directory.
after that, cd back to my directory using cd ../ inside of the directory, make another directory called vamps using mkdir vamps.
go to scoobies directory using cd scobbies, then touch buffy.txt and hit entre.
touch angel.txt again and hit the entre.

Cos you just created two text files inside of the scoobies directory, you should be in scobbies directory.
not sure? do pwd.
Once you ls in the scobbies folder, you will be able to see the files that you just created.
"cp angel.txt cd../vamps" - if you do this, you will be able to copy the file into the vamps directory.

to remove the folder of vamps,
rm -r vamps
